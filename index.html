            <p>How many sentences are in a paragraph? It is important to note that there is a great deal of variety in 
                how long a paragraph is and there is not a minimum or maximum number of sentences that it must have to 
                fit its definition. Some writers will opt to use very short paragraphs, while others will include dozens 
                of sentences in their paragraphs. It is also important to know that most writers separate lines of dialogue 
                into paragraphs, so if a character only speaks a single line, it will be its own paragraph.  Keeping that in 
                mind, there is a general agreement on the format of a standard paragraph, which especially applies to informational 
                and argumentative or persuasive writing. A paragraph should be divided into three distinct sections that 
                each serve a purpose to the paragraph as a whole.  How many sentences are in a paragraph? It is important to note
