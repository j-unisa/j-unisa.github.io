            <p>I became interested in software engineering when I stumbled upon a book titled 
                <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com" class="special" id="whitish-slate" 
                    target="_blank">"Automate the Boring Stuff"</a>.  
                During the height of the pandemic an opportunity 
                to gain more knowledge in my field of IT arose in the form of 
                <a href="https://codeinplace.stanford.edu" id="whitish-slate" 
                    target="_blank">Code in Place</a>, 
                an introductory course in coding from Stanford University.  I was introduced 
                to Python, the fundamentals of programming and various computer science 
                concepts.  I furthered my knowledge of coding and fundamentals of computer 
                science with 
                <a href="https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-

                    target="_blank">Harvard's Intro to Computer Science</a> 
                on the online education platform edX.org.  There I learned more about Python 
                as well as C, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</p>
