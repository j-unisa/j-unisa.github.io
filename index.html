            <p>I became interested in coding when I found a book titled 
                <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com" class="special-teal whitish-slate" 
                    target="_blank">"Automate the Boring Stuff"</a>.  I was able to use what 
                I learned to set some repetitive tasks on autopilot at work. Some time after 
                reading this book, I was lucky enough to come across an opportunity 
                to gain more knowledge in my field of IT, in the form of 
                <a href="https://codeinplace.stanford.edu" class="special-teal whitish-slate" 
                    target="_blank">Code in Place</a>, 
                an introductory course in coding from Stanford University.  I was introduced 
                to Python, the fundamentals of programming and various computer science 
                concepts.  The curiosity that this course brought out in me started to make me
                reconsider my career path.  I wanted to explore more of the software engineering
                world so I furthered my knowledge of coding and fundamentals of computer science with 
                <a href="https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-
                    introduction-to-computer-science?webview=false&campaign=CS50%27s+

                    target="_blank">Harvard's Intro to Computer Science</a> 
                on the online education platform edX.org.  There I learned more about Python 
                as well as C, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</p>
            <p>I continue to widen my knowledge of and skills in software engineering through 
            personal projects, coding challenges on 
                <a href="https://www.codewars.com/dashboard" class="special-teal whitish-slate" 
                    target="_blank">Codewars</a> 
            and searching for groups or forums that discuss software engineering.  I also hope 
            to find open source projects in which I can gain more experience and learn more to 
            help me gain the skills in which I can use to start a career in software engineering.</p>
